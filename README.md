# jsnn
A very simple neural network in Javascript

This is a very simple project I did some years ago. It contains Javascript files handling the neural networks and a simple training example for a Connect 4 in the HTML file. The storage of the neural networks is not included here, but you can easily do it in several ways, including a PHP script.
